# Experiments and Notes

## 2025-11-xx – Initial bring-up

- Verified ESP32 boots reliably from Arkare 5V 2A adapter.
- Confirmed both HC-SR04 sensors report distance with the lid open.

## Ideas

- Add deep-sleep mode if this ever goes on battery.
- Try moving sensors to different positions to see which gives the most
  stable fullness readings.
