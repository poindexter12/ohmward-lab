# Ohmward Lab

A collection of small to medium hardware builds: ESP32-based sensors, home
automation gadgets, measurement tools, and 3D-printed accessories.

Each project is self-contained with wiring diagrams, BOMs, firmware, and
enclosure files.

## Structure

- `projects/` – individual hardware builds
- `common/` – shared guides, parts, tools, and templates
- `docs/` – global documentation, standards, and diagrams
- `assets/` – shared images and logos

## Current Projects

- `trashcan-sensor` – ESP32 + dual HC-SR04 sensor to estimate trashcan fullness

## Getting Started

1. Pick a project under `projects/`.
2. Read its local `README.md`.
3. Follow the wiring diagram and firmware instructions.
